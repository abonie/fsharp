# Local Visual Studio Extension Development

This skill provides guidance on building, deploying, and iterating on the Visual Studio extension locally using the experimental instance of Visual Studio.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2026 installed with the **Visual Studio extension development** workload
- The `vs-mcp-testing-tools` skill must be loaded to understand how to use the MCP tools for testing after deployment

## Rebuild & Deploy Workflow

After making code changes to the VS extension, follow these steps **in order** to rebuild and deploy:

### 1. Close All Experimental VS Instances

Run the helper script to close any running experimental instances:

```powershell
.github/skills/vs-local-development/scripts/close-exp-instances.ps1
```

This kills all `devenv.exe` processes launched with `/rootsuffix`.

### 2. Rebuild the Solution

Run the build script:

```powershell
./Build.cmd -c Debug
```

### 3. Deploy the VSIX

Use the deploy script to install the VSIX, wait for the installer to finish, and clear caches in one step:

```powershell
.github/skills/vs-local-development/scripts/deploy-to-vs.ps1 "artifacts\VSSetup\Debug\VisualFSharpDebug.vsix"
```

This script:
- Installs the VSIX into the experimental hive (`/rootSuffix:exp`)

### 4. Reopen VS

The extension is now installed. Open the experimental instance normally:

```powershell
devenv /rootsuffix exp
```

## Quick Reference (Copy-Paste)

Full sequence for a rebuild cycle:

```powershell
# 1. Stop experimental instances
.github/skills/vs-local-development/scripts/close-exp-instances.ps1

# 2. Rebuild
./Build.cmd -c Debug

# 3. Deploy VSIX (install, wait, clear caches)
.github/skills/vs-local-development/scripts/deploy-to-vs.ps1 "artifacts\VSSetup\Debug\VisualFSharpDebug.vsix"

# 4. Reopen VS with the updated extension
devenv /rootsuffix exp
```

## Key Concepts

### Experimental Instance

Visual Studio supports **experimental instances** (`/rootsuffix exp`) — isolated environments with separate extension registrations and settings. This allows developing and testing extensions without affecting your main VS installation.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| VSIX install fails | Ensure all experimental VS instances are closed (`.github/skills/vs-local-development/scripts/close-exp-instances.ps1`) |
| Extension not appearing in VS | Re-run `deploy-to-vs.ps1` or manually run `devenv /rootsuffix exp /clearcache` and `/updateconfiguration` |
| Old version still loaded | Delete `artifacts/` and rebuild |

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Making changes to the VS extension (`VisualFSharpFull` or `VisualFSharpDebug`)
- Needing to test extension changes locally in Visual Studio
- Troubleshooting VSIX deployment to the experimental instance
- Setting up a local VS extension development loop
