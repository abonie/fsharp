# Visual Studio MCP Tools

This skill provides guidance on using the Visual Studio MCP (Model Context Protocol) server tools for automating Visual Studio workflows, test generation, and troubleshooting F# IDE features.

## Quick Start

1. Verify `vs-open-solution` tool is available (MCP server is set up).
2. Open a solution: `vs-open-solution path="C:\path\to\MySolution.sln"`
3. Open a source file with `vs-open-file`
4. Wait 10 seconds for the errors to populate, then use `vs-get-error-list` tool to get the list of errors.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users need help with:

- Setting up or using VS MCP testing tools
- Integration testing VS F# features
- Debugging F# LSP server at the VS UI level

## Key Rules

- Use **full absolute paths in single quotes** for file-based annotations via MCP (e.g., `#file:'C:\path\to\File.cs'`).
- Don't mix different annotation scope types in a single request.
